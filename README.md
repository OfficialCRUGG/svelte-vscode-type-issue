# Svelte VSCode Type Issue

This is a demo of a type issue I'm having with Svelte.

## How this project was created

```bash
pnpm create svelte
```

I used the Library Starter with TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.

## The Issue

See /src/routes/+page.svelte in VS Code with the Svelte Extension installed.
